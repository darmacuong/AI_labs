    "High quality data is important in machine learning. However, data quality can suffer as a result of manual labelling. Even when annotation guidelines are provided to human labelers, the labels can be inconsistent. One way to evaluate quality of the labels is to evaluate the inter-rater agreement for the human labels. In the exercise you will compute intersection over uninion (IoU) on bounding boxes. IOU is an evaluation metric used to measure the accuracy of an object detector on a particular dataset.  <br>\n",

To load an image, simply use the `imread('PATH')` and `imshow()` functions of the matplotlib.image module. The `imread('PATH')` function assigns numpy array to a variable of which can be rendered with `imshow()` function. Python uses image data in form of NumPy array `[Height, Width, Channel]` format. Try printing the numpy array of the image."
